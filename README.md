# Duplication_in_FGM

## Name
Genotypic reinterpretation of Fisher's Geometric Model.

## Description
The aim of this project is to implement a reinterpretation of Fisher's Geometric Model on Python that allow the user to have access to the individual's genotype and not only its phenotype, so that it is possible to study the concept of gene duplication and its consequences on evolution.
For more detailed information on the use of this code for the study of gene duplication in FGM, see : (article)

## Installation
No particular installation are recquired to run simulations with this code. 
The user must just be aware that only a Python version is provided.
Python's library Numpy and Matplotlib (and multiprocessing for parallel computation) are the only necessary tools to use this project.
Run the following lines on at a time in the command terminal:
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
Possible amelioration of the model could follow this code

## Project status
Development as stopped because wanted simulations has been realised. New simulations may come in future works
