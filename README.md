# Duplication_in_FGM

## Name
Model Gene Duplication/Divergence in Fisher's Geometric Model.

## Description
The aim of this project is to implement a reinterpretation of Fisher's Geometric Model on Python that allow the user to have access to the individual's genotype and not only its phenotype, so that it is possible to study the concept of gene duplication and its consequences on evolution.
For more detailed information on the use of this code for the study of gene duplication in FGM, see : (article)

## Installation
No particular installation are recquired to run simulations with this code. 
The user must just be aware that only a Python version is provided.
Python's library Numpy and and Matplotlib are the only necessary tools to use this project.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
